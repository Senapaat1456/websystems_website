    <h3>Website by Andrew Senapatiratne</h3>
    <h3>Link to website: <a href="index.html">here</a></h3>
    <h2>Expectations and how I met them, in order:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The Project is for the Data Analytics Assocation, an on-campus group. </li>
      <li>Each page of the site has a header.  </li>
      <li>The site has five separate pages including: Homepage, R Guide, GGPlot2 Guide, Calander, and Leadership Page  </li>
      <li>There are links through the pages including in the header.  </li>
      <li>The site has a separate layout for small and large screens.  </li>
      <li>There is a master style sheet to keep a consistent style across the pages  </li>
        <li>The cite has images on almost all its pages, and each image has its own alternate text for accessibility. The scrolling slide show on the home page does automatically update the alternate text when the images change.  </li>
      <li>Each page has a custom favicon (it’s not beautiful, I am no graphic designer).  </li>
      <li>Everything is sorted into proper folders, including subfolders for the images.  </li>
      <li>The site is not built on any libraries or frameworks.  </li>
      <li>I tested all html and css files and they all passed without any issues.  </li>
      <li>I shared the git repository with you.  </li>
      <li>All file names are lowercase and alphanumeric.  </li>
      <li>The website is served out of port 8443.  </li>
      <li>It is a https connection.  </li>
      <li>The content is neatly aligned.  </li>
      <li>The site has two different fonts, sans-serif for the headings and serif for the body.  </li>
      <li>The “GGPlot2 Basics” page has the user submit information to generate R code.  </li>
      <li>The “Installing R” page has many links to outside resources for R.  </li>
      <li>The code is readable.  </li>
      <li>The homepage as a rotating slide show animation made with javascript.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <h3>From Collin Goldsworthy</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>I like the color scheme a lot! (Keeping it minty fresh like our MUDAC presentation)   </li>
      <li>I also like that you included helpful visuals, and I really like the code generator!   </li>
      <li>I’d put some padding at the bottom of the home page and tutorial pages so that you can scroll up and not have text stuck at the bottom of the browser window. </li>
      <li>I like the idea of the random pictures on the home page, but the way they change feels a little awkward. A cool middle ground might be to just have it randomly select 3 images each time the user goes to the homepage.  </li>
      <li>Maybe make the logo on the top be a link to the homepage since that’s common practice. There’s a few spelling errors on each page, just copy paste your text into word and it’ll catch all of them.  </li>
      <li>For the leadership page Tyler is the Secretary, Eric is the Treasurer. If you want, you could also include a picture of Abra, but that’s not 100 percent necessary. </li>
    </ol>
